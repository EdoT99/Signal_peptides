The project aims to compare two deterministic methods: Gunnar Von Heijne model and SVM for predicting secretory signal peptides in proteins which is of primary importance in localizing protein compartment and functional characterization. After a 10-fold cross-validation analysis on a benchmark set of the two developed methods,
despite some misclassification errors, SVM is the best-performing method having a higher MCC, precision, and F1
score.
